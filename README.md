# React App for Shopify Store

## üöÄ Project Purpose
- To spin up a dev environment where a custom app can be integrated alongside Hydrogen and the Shopify Vite plugin.
- The React app serves as a template for exploring and manipulating Shopify data retrieved from GraphQL APIs
- This empowers devs to quickly prototype functionalities and gain insights into data structures and manipulation capabilities before diving into full-fledged application development

## üî® Dev Environment:
- node version
    - `nvm use 18.12.1`
- open 3 dev terminals: 
    - vite, tailwindcss, shopify theme CLI
- vite server
    - `pnpm vite:dev `
        - spin up the vite preview environment. 
        - You don't actually need the Shopify CLI `shopify theme dev` to just preview your React app.
        - However, you will need the Shopify theme's preview link to access the preview.
- shopify theme CLI 
    - `shopify theme dev -s [shopname] -t [theme_id] --live-reload=full-page`
- tailwind
    - `pnpm watch-tailwind`
- [Build] Rebuild the assets/ folder, and the minified files (eg:xx.min.js) in it. (vite)
    - `pnpm build`
- [Deploy] push built assets files to shopify
    - `shopify theme push -s [shopname] -t [theme_id]`
- [Deploy issue] Deploy to shopify
    - Deploying `(pnpm build && shopify theme push...)` sometimes requires multiple attempts. During the initial builds, the preview link might still attempt to fetch assets from localhost:5173.
